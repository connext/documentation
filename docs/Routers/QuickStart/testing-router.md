# Testing a Router

Once the router is up and running, the next step is to test swaps on it.

## Using the UI

The [NXTP Test UI](https://nxtp.connext.network) is a web-based UI for testing cross-chain swaps. It can be used to individually test a router, bypassing the router auction process.

Once your router has liquidity on the receiving side, you can test it through the UI. Open the UI and go to the "Swap" tab. Provide the info for your desired swap and input the preferred router you want to test.
