# Crosschain Txs

The core flow for sending a transaction through Connext consists of:
1. Getting a transfer quote: returns an estimated price and commitment for the transfer.
2. Starting the transfer: sends the user's transaction on chain A and waits for the network to provide liquidity.
3. Finishing the transfer: completes the user's transaction on chain B.

## GetTransferQuote

The `getTransferQuote` function accepts the following arguments:
- `sendingAssetId`: _Required_. Address of token on the initiating chain. Use `Address(0)` for native assets like $ETH.
- `sendingChainId`: _Required_. [ChainId](https://chainid.network/) of the initiating chain.
- `receivingAssetId`: _Required_. Address of token on the receiving chain. Use `Address(0)` for native assets like $ETH.
- `receivingChainId`: _Required_. [ChainId](https://chainid.network/) of the receiving chain.
- `receivingAddress`: _Required_. Address that the token will be sent to on receiving chain. If `callData` and `callTo` is provided, then `receivingAddress` acts as a fallback in case of a contract revert on the receiving chain.
- `amount`: _Required_. Amount of funds (as BigNumber) to be sent either as a transaction or along with a calldata payload.
- `expiry`: _Required_. Fallback duration after which a tx is forcibly reverted if there is no response from the network. Recommended: 72 hours.
- `callTo`: _Optional_. Destination contract address if doing a crosschain contract call.
- `callData`: _Optional_. Calldata for crosschain contract call.

It returns an [AuctionResponse](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/blob/c4-68/packages/utils/src/messaging.ts#L259) object.

Example:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ts"
  values={[
    { label: 'Typescript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="ts">

```ts
const quote = await sdk.getTransferQuote({
  sendingAssetId: "0x9aC2c46d7AcC21c881154D57c0Dc1c55a3139198",
  sendingChainId: 4,
  receivingAssetId: "0x8a1Cad3703E0beAe0e0237369B4fcD04228d1682",
  receivingChainId: 5,
  receivingAddress: "0x5A9e792143bf2708b4765C144451dCa54f559a11",
  amount: utils.parseEther("1"),
  expiry: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600 * 24 * 3, // 3 days
});

// You can validate price paid by user with data from quote
const feeEstimate = amount.sub(quote.bid.amountReceived);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Executing the Transaction

First, `startTransfer` to initiate the transaction to our contracts. Then, wait for the transaction to be prepared on the receiving chain and call `finishTransfer`.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ts"
  values={[
    { label: 'Typescript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="ts">

```ts
// start transfer, will either prompt user for sigs/transactions or sign with unlocked account
const transfer = await sdk.startTransfer(quote);

// wait for receiver prepared event
const prepared = await sdk.waitFor(
  NxtpSdkEvents.ReceiverTransactionPrepared,
  100_000,
  (data) => data.txData.transactionId === transfer.transactionId // filter function
);

await sdk.finishTransfer(prepared);
// done!
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
